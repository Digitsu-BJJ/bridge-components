When enabled, locks the app when it is backgrounded until the user authenticates via biometrics.

First, add the following to *every page* of your application. This ensures the app correctly locks when it enters the background.

```html
<meta data-controller="bridge--biometrics-lock">
```

Enable the lock by calling `#enable`. For example, when the user signs in.

```html
<div data-controller="bridge--biometrics-lock">
  <button data-action="bridge--biometrics-lock#enable">
    Enable lock
  </button>
</div>
```

Disable the lock by calling `#disable`. For example, when the user signs out.

```html
<div data-controller="bridge--biometrics-lock">
  <button data-action="bridge--biometrics-lock#disable">
    Disable lock
  </button>
</div>
```
